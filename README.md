🥛 Milk Medals for Trackmania 2020 🥛

🌉Milk Medals is a bridge-difficulty plugin designed to fill the "no-man's land" between the Gold Medal and the Author Medal.

🧪The Formula

The Medal is calculated using a 0.40 ratio (may change on feedback). 

It targets the upper-tier of the gap between Gold and AT:

$$\text{MilkTime} = \text{AuthorTime} + (\text{GoldTime} - \text{AuthorTime}) \times 0.40$$

🏁Standard Tracks: It sits at 40% of the way from the Author Time toward the Gold Time. 

⏱️Short Tracks (Gap < 800ms): The plugin automatically switches to a 50/50 split to ensure the medal remains a distinct, achievable milestone.

⚡Features 

✨Live Notifications: Get a custom "Milk Medal Earned!" toast notification when you achieve the time. (I also want to add a small audio cue but I can't understand how it works. Help is always welcome!

🏅UME Integration: Fully compatible with Ultimate Medals Extended, allowing the Milk Medal to appear alongside standard and other popular medals. 

🤝Toggle the standalone HUD and the ability to Show/Hide deltas. 

📈Goals 

🖼️Add custom medal PNG on campaign menu.

🎯Make it so this medal can get used by challenges plugins (Bingo, RACC, etc.). 

🎮Create my own "challenge" plugin that allows instant skip to the next map once the medal is achieved by one player in the server. (Feel free to make it yourself if you want; contact me so we can add this tier as well!) 

👥Credits 

✍️This is my first project not only on OpenPlanet but on coding as a whole it was a blast!

Special thanks to Ford and ArEyeses who helped me on the OpenPlanet Discord. 💻

(I also used AI to understand stuff without spamming the Discord; the code has been changed and made readable as per request of the rules. Some parts still remained as I deemed them to be the best course of action.)
