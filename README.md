Milk Medals for Trackmania 2020

Milk Medals is a bridge-difficulty plugin designed to fill the "no-man's land" between the Gold Medal and the Author Medal (AT).

If Gold feels too easy but the Author feels impossible, it’s time to go for the Milk.

The Formula 

The Medal is calculated using a 0.40 ratio (may change on feedback). 

It targets the upper-tier of the gap between Gold and AT:

$$\text{MilkTime} = \text{AuthorTime} + (\text{GoldTime} - \text{AuthorTime}) \times 0.40$$

Standard Tracks: It sits at 40% of the way from the Author Time toward the Gold Time.

Short Tracks (Gap < 800ms): The plugin automatically switches to a 50/50 split to ensure the medal remains a distinct, achievable milestone.

Features

Live Notifications: Get a custom "Milk Medal Earned!" toast notification when you archieve the time. (I also want to add a small audio cue but i can't understand how it works. Help is always welcome!!)

UME Integration: Fully compatible with Ultimate Medals Extended, allowing the Milk Medal to appear alongside standard and other popular medals.

Toggle the standalone HUD.

Show/Hide deltas.

Goals

-Add custom medal png on campaign menu
-Make it so this medal can get used by challenges plugins. (Bingo, RACC, ect.)
-Create my own "challenge" plugin that allows instant skip next map once medal archieved by one player in server (feel free to make it yourself if you want, contact me so we can add this tier aswell)

The main reason this plugin was created was to have a new tier difficulty while playing with my friends.

Special thanks to Ford and ArEyeses who helped me on the OpenPlanet discord.

(i also used AI to understand stuff without spamming the discord, the code has been changed and made readable as per request of the rules. some parts still remained as i deemed them to be the best course of action)
